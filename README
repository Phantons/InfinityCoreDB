InfinityCore DB is a World of Warcraft Mists of Pandaria MySQL Database.

This being said, This database is actually SkyFireDB for 4.0.6a. I have
modified it to work with TrinityCore's 4.3.4 branch. As I work on the core
to make it work with 5.0.5b (16135) I will be modifying the Database, and 
updating it here.

I never do any work without sharing. You may find this useful, but I do not
guarantee it will work, and it is by no means "Blizzlike". Eventually someone
(probably the devs at TrinityCore... http://www.trinitycore.org) will make
a good working 5.0.5 Database... or maybe not. Blizzard updates so often,
it is hard to keep up.
